<h1>The Best Movies According to Gbenga</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all time. </h2>

<hr />

<h3>John Wick</h3>
<p>This is my favourite action movie because John was very intriguing and unstopable. The action sequences were amazing.</p>

<h3>Coco</h3>
<p> This is one of my favourite movies because of the animation and the fact that it is a musical.</p>

<h3>The Wolf of Wallstreet</h3>
<p> This is on of my favourite movies because it taught sales manship and shows how wolfy was able to convince people to buy seemingly cheap stocks.</p>
